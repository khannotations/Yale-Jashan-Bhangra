      %p Yale Jashan is a cultural dance troupe that celebrates the vibrant South Asian dance known as Bhangra. The art is grounded in a traditional dance performed in the Punjab region of South Asia, with influence from modern pop and hip-hop styles.  
      %p Yale Jashan Bhangra is a highly visible group that connects the greater Yale population to the fun, colorful traditions of South Asia.  Yale students from across the College and Graduate schools comprise the team.  YJB practices three times per week in preparation for performances on and off campus, in addition to competitions held throughout the east coast.
